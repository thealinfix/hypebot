CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT:

You are helping refactor a Python Telegram bot (hypebot.py) into a modular architecture.

Original: 2500+ line monolithic bot for sneaker/fashion news monitoring
Tech: Python 3.10+, python-telegram-bot, OpenAI API, asyncio

Current task: Creating modular files one by one
Style: Full implementation, no placeholders, async/await, proper error handling

To resume:
1. Run: python3 next_file.py
2. Create the indicated file
3. Follow patterns from existing files in bot/utils/

Key patterns:
- Async functions with proper error handling
- Logging via logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
- State access via bot/utils/state.py functions
- Decorators from bot/utils/decorators.py
- Time handling via bot/utils/time_utils.py

Next file will be shown by next_file.py script.
