- [x] Smart tag system and filtering
- [x] Advanced scheduling system
- [x] Auto-publishing from favorites
- [x] Timezone support
- [x] Multi-source parsing (RSS/JSON)
- [x] Image analysis with GPT-4 Vision
- [x] Custom prompt support for image generation

## In Progress üöß
- [ ] Performance optimization for image processing
- [ ] Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

## Planned Features üìã

### Phase 1: Database & Performance
- [ ] PostgreSQL/SQLite integration
- [ ] Migration tool from JSON to DB
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Caching layer for API responses
- [ ] Parallel image processing

### Phase 2: User Features
- [ ] Multi-admin support with roles
- [ ] User subscription system
- [ ] Personal preferences per user
- [ ] Notification customization
- [ ] Search functionality in bot

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Web dashboard for analytics
- [ ] REST API for external integrations
- [ ] Price tracking and alerts
- [ ] Size availability monitoring
- [ ] Raffles and draws tracking
- [ ] Multi-language support (EN/RU/ES)

### Phase 4: Scaling
- [ ] Multiple Telegram channels support
- [ ] Integration with Discord
- [ ] More sources (10+ planned)
- [ ] Regional market support
- [ ] Automated A/B testing for posts

## Known Limitations üîç
1. **Storage**: Currently uses JSON (state.json)
   - Solution: Implement database layer
   
2. **Scalability**: Single instance only
   - Solution: Add Redis for distributed state
   
3. **Recovery**: No automatic backup
   - Solution: Implement backup service
   
4. **Monitoring**: Basic logging only
   - Solution: Add metrics and alerting

## Performance Benchmarks üöÄ
- Current: ~50 posts/minute processing
- Target: 200+ posts/minute
- Memory usage: <100MB
- API calls optimization needed

## Contributing Guidelines ü§ù
1. Follow existing code patterns
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Use type hints
5. Handle errors gracefully

## Version History
- v1.0.0 - Initial modular release
- v0.1.0 - Original monolithic version
